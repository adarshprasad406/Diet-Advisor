ðŸ§¬ Clinical Dietary Advisor for Potassium Levels (Streamlit App)


âœ… Problem Overview
This project is a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) that provides personalized dietary advice based on a patient's potassium level and whether they have chronic kidney disease (CKD).

It is built using Streamlit, a Python library that turns scripts into interactive web apps.


ðŸ“– Background
Maintaining proper potassium levels is critical in CKD patients:

<3.5 mmol/L â†’ Low potassium (hypokalemia): requires potassium-rich foods

3.5 to 5.0 mmol/L â†’ Normal potassium: generally no dietary change

5.0 mmol/L â†’ High potassium (hyperkalemia): requires dietary restriction
>

ðŸŽ¯ App Features
ðŸ“¥ User Inputs:

Potassium level (float)

CKD status (Yes/No)


ðŸ’¡ Outputs:

Health warning if potassium is too high/low

Recommended foods to eat

Foods to avoid (if needed)

Simple, readable layout using Streamlit UI
