🧬 Clinical Dietary Advisor for Potassium Levels


A Streamlit-based web app that provides personalized dietary recommendations based on a patient's potassium level and kidney disease status. Built as a lightweight Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) to assist healthcare decision-making.

📖 Problem Statement
In patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), maintaining optimal potassium levels is crucial:

🟡 Low potassium (< 3.5 mmol/L) → Risk of muscle weakness & irregular heartbeats. Recommend potassium-rich foods.

🟢 Normal (3.5 – 5.0 mmol/L) → No immediate dietary change unless on special medications.

🔴 High potassium (> 5.0 mmol/L) → Dangerous. Recommend avoiding potassium-rich foods.
